# Tensorflow

Here I have trained models using Tensorflow(Keras) using real world datasets to predict certain parameters as defined in the project.
In the first project in the master branch I have used data from a Kaggle data set regarding housing prices to predict the price of a brand new house

In the TF branch I have trained a model to explore data classification using Keras and have used a breastcancer diagnosis data set. Model was trained and various parameters analyzed.
